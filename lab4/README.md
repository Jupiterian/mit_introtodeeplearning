# MIT 6.S191 Lab 4: Reinforcement Learning

In this lab, we focus on building a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity.

Cartpole: Balance a pole, protruding from a cart, in an upright position by only moving the base left or right. Environment with a low-dimensional observation space.

Driving in VISTA: Learn a driving control policy for an autonomous vehicle, end-to-end from raw pixel inputs and entirely in the data-driven simulation environment of VISTA. Environment with a high-dimensional observation space - learning directly from raw pixels.
