# MIT 6.S191 Lab 2: Debiasing, Uncertainty, and Robustness

# Part 1: Introduction to Capsa
In this lab, we'll explore different ways to make deep learning models more robust and trustworthy.

To achieve this it is critical to be able to identify and diagnose issues of bias and uncertainty in deep learning models. We need benchmarks that uniformly measure how uncertain a given model is, and we need principled ways of measuring bias and uncertainty. To that end, in this lab, we'll utilize Capsa, a risk-estimation wrapping library developed by Themis AI.

# Part 2: Mitigating Bias and Uncertainty in Facial Detection Systems
In Lab 2, we defined a semi-supervised VAE (SS-VAE) to diagnose feature representation disparities and biases in facial detection systems. We will use Capsa to build systems that can automatically uncover and mitigate bias and uncertainty in facial detection systems.
